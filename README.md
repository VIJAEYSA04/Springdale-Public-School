In this project, I've utilized React Bootstrap to build the navbar and carousels. CSS animations were employed for typewriting and blinking text effects, while all styling, positioning, colors, and fonts were custom-defined. I included YouTube videos using iframes. Each part was implemented as a separate component, with props used to enhance code reusability. This is the first version of a desktop-friendly website, with updates for mobile and tablet compatibility coming soon.
